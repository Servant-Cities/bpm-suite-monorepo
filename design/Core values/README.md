# Core Values

## Transparency

All the components of this project should aim to provide complete and evidences backed information to the end users impacted by each processes' design and operation.

While we should build something usable for profit by companies willing to use it, our first aim is to deliver working softwares to public services and therefore consider each information to be critical for human rights and democratic institutions, nothing less.

In this context, specific details matter more than design conformism, while not being mutually incompatible so the contributors should aim to deliver all the means to share information and - most importantly - consider the lack of information an information to be displayed. 


## Accountability

The contributors should aim for all scenarios created using this project's components to collect evidences of accountability - or the lack of it. 

The accountability is expressed from the organisation to its collaborators, partners, customers and beneficiaries, as well as all future people identified as impacted by the operation of a process ran trough the protocol.

We are not building police softwares overseeing public servant's work to try and punish eventual mistakes, we are building a written information driven workspace for participatory and deliberative management.

In order to do so, and to prevent institutionalism and bureaucracy to grow more important than people's right, we build softwares providing decision making information which can in time demonstrate social issues such as systemic discrimination - otherwise made invisible - and provide a sandbox environment enabling to issue recomendations.

Trust in democratic institution should be built on information driven decision making, not on blank promises or popularity, our hypothesis is that good people will always harm, as long as they don't have the right information to sense this harm, we design to empower advocacy, not political figures.


## Participation and deliberation

We believe feedback is the key and should always be allowed so that it can - in time - get some consideration.

People are sometimes abused and left with no way to redress the situation, facing institutions blind and deaf to their suffering, sometimes because they simply don't have the capacity to process this feedback.

The lack of capacity shouldn't prevent the collection of information regarding social issues and each individual should'nt have to bear the administrative burden of collecting and grouping the evidences of the abuse on their own, neither to go trough the struggle of finding someone able to help them.

Crowdsourcing the quality metrics - or feedbacks - of a public service should be eased in order to give some issues the proper political weight, not only trough influence and mass media, but trough contextualized data.

The contributors should commit not to design the project's components as top down solutions, leaving people with unrelevant processes built in an ivory tower, but instead empower all impacted humans to participate into improving both the processes and this project.

While it is still a bit unclear how at that state, the original hope behind this value is to use this project as an infrastructure for inclusive deliberation.


## Interoperability

(to be done)


## Scepticism

We might be wrong and we might transform.
